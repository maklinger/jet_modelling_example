//Class for mixed particles, inherited from the generic Particles class in Particles.hh
//the minimum momentum of the PL is always be assumed to be the averge momentum of the thermal
//note: ndens is number density per unit momentum

//The reasons the integrands are friends is kind of magic. Basically, we need pointers to the private members
//Temp/thnorm/theta/whatever to set the parameters of the integrand functions in the GSL libraries. In C++
//this is not possible for non-static private member functions (because otherwise we could access private
//members from the outside by using a pointer). To quote the compiler error, C++ forbids
//taking the address of an unqualified or parenthesized non-static member function to form a pointer to
//member function. And we need a pointer member function void *p to set up the integrands for GSL libraries.
//By using a friend function we can instead set up a set of parameters whose value is that of a pointer which 
//points at the values stored in the private members; by doing this, we can not change the private members' 
//values (correctly so) but we can still access their numerical value and use it elsewhere.
